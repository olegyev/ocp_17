== Compile `Main.java`
Class `Main.java` includes `main()` method, which runs `greetings()` method from all other classes (the method just prints text) - `ClassA.java`, `ClassB.java`, `ClassC.java`, `ClassD.java`, `ClassE.java`.

.Compiling from the source root folder - `packages`.
```
javac packageb/Main.java
```
This command compiles the `Main.java` file and all its dependencies automatically. *NO need to compile all the dependencies separately.* Though it is possible (*order of the classes is NOT important*, also, *we can call `javac` on all the classess separately* in any order):
```
javac packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java packageb/ClassE.java packageb/Main.java
```
*NB!* Please, note that all the package-private classes from the file `ClassB.java` (i.e. `ClassC.java` and `ClassD.java`) are compiled automatically when compiling their parent file - `ClassB.java`. So, there 3 _.class_ files will be generated after `javac packageb/ClassB.java`: `ClassB.class`, `ClassC.class`, `ClassD.class`.

.Compiling from another folder.
In that case, we need to provide `-sourcepath` (or `--source-path`; also `-cp`, `-classpath`, or `--class-path` can be used) option pointing out to the *source root folder* (`C:\Users\oyevs\Desktop\projects\packages` in our case).

Compiling `Main.java` from `C:\Users\oyevs\Desktop`:
```
javac -sourcepath ./projects/packages ./projects/packages/packageb/Main.java
```

Compiling `Main.java` from its folder `C:\Users\oyevs\Desktop\projects\packages\packageb`:
```
javac --source-path .. Main.java
```

*NB!* If the `-sourcepath` option is not specified, the user's `-classpath` is searched for source files as well as class files (see below).

.Compiling with wildcards.
We can use an asterisk to specify that youâ€™d like to include all Java files in a directory:
```
javac packagea/*.java packageb/*.java
```

.Compile to another directory
By default, _.class_ files are generated in the same folders as the source _.java_ files.

To store them in another folder, we can use `-d` option (e.g. compiling from the source root folder):
```
javac -d classes packageb/Main.java
```

As a result, _.class_ files will be stored under `C:\Users\oyevs\Desktop\projects\packages\classes` folder according to their packages:

`.\classes\packagea\ClassA.class`,
`.\classes\packageb\Main.class`, etc.

== Run `Main.class`
.Bytecode compiled in the source code files' folder.
Run from within the source root folder - `packages`:
```
java packageb.Main
```

Run from another folder (Main class' folder) - use `-classpath` (`-cp`, `--class-path`) option:
```
java -cp .. packageb.Main
java -classpath .. packageb.Main
java --class-path .. packageb.Main
```

*NB!* [red]#Package name should be always provided as class name's prefix# while running, because [red]#JVM identified classes by their fully-qualified class names#, which is actually used in the bytecode.

.Bytecode compiled to another folder - `.\packages\classes`.
We need to use `-classpath` (`-cp`, `--class-path`) option (Run from within the source root folder - `packages`):
```
java -cp classes packageb.Main
java -classpath classes packageb.Main
java --class-path classes packageb.Main
```

.Single-File Source-Code
Compile and run in one command ("Hello, world!" and Test are command line program parameters/arguments)
```
java Main.java "Hello, world!" Test
```

== Compile and run with JAR files
*NB!* Only compiled files can be added to the JAR.

To create JAR file (`packagea.ClassA` is compiled into `.\classes\packagea`, creating JAR from within this folder:
```
 jar -cvf testJar.jar .
 jar --create --verbose --file testJar.jar .
```

To create JAR file from the source root folder - `packages` (for the same compiled class) - use `-C` option to define directory containing files to be used to create the JAR:
```
jar -cvf testJar.jar -C classes .
jar --create --verbose --file testJar.jar -C classes .
```

To compile `Main.java` into `.\classes` folder using JAR dependency of `packagea.ClassA`:

On *Windows* (separator - `;`)
```
javac -cp ".;.\classes" -d classes packageb/Main.java
```

On **NIX* (separator - `:`)
```
javac -cp ".:.\classes" -d classes packageb/Main.java
```

To run `Main` class from within the JAR (from `C:\Users\oyevs\Desktop` folder):
```
java -cp ".\projects\*" packageb.Main
```

Other examples on how to provide multiple classpathes (also, for JARs):

On *Windows*
```
java -cp
".;C:\temp\someOtherLocation;c:\temp\myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
```

On **NIX*
```
java -cp
".:/tmp/someOtherLocation:/tmp/myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
```

We can use a *wildcard (*)* to match all the JARs in a directory
```
java -cp
"C:\temp\directoryWithJars\*" myPackage.MyClass
```
